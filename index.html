				The Ivy League (also known as The Ancient Eight) is an American collegiate athletic
				conference comprising eight private research universities in the Northeastern
				United States. The term Ivy League is typically used beyond the sports context to
				refer to the eight schools as a group of elite colleges with connotations of
				academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.
